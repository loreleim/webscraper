# Web Scraping w/ Puppeteer
Node.js web scraper to pull data from sites in json formats

## Why use a web scraper?
The Internet is full of data! But oftentimes, this data isn't accessible for development needs. Ideally, all non-sensitive info on websites would be stored in public APIs. So that data could be reproduced, UX'd and spread amongst various digital medias. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Many databases are still legacy code. So Web Scraping can be utilized to pull all this legacy info, into nice JSON formats. 

Perfect for Node.js databases! 

## The bones
The framework of this scraping tool is built with [Puppeteer.js](). 

```
npm install -g puppeteer
```
